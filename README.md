## Preparation Phase

It took me a bit more than 2 months to prepare for the interviews. I solved around 200-220 problems from leetcode within this time frame. But, I repeated the blind75 list 4 times. Something that I would like to mention is that, no one really has to do it within 2 months if possible. If I could, I would at least take 4 months to prepare. Take things in your own pace. Don't be upset if it takes you more than you expected. It's okay. 

### How I studied

Being a working professional while being not so good at data structures and algorithms was a barrier in the initial days. I knew that I can't really solve problems blindly unless I studied them. So, in the earlier days, I learned all the most frequent data structures and algorithms. My study flow was: stack/queue -> linked list -> tree -> graph -> heap -> dynamic programming -> (after many many practices on previous ones) -> greedy -> randomized algorithms. 

I used to start with a topic and solve problems. For easier topics, I took 2-3days. For the difficult ones(dynamic programming), I took more than 2 weeks. After a week or two, I used to come back to the previous topics and re-solve them. 

To learn the data structures and, to be proficient enough to solve most medium problems within 20-25 minutes, took me around 1 and a half month. Within this time(end of february), I solved all the blind75 problems 2 times. And 2 more times later on. I could solve them pretty fast by the end. In terms of unseen hard problems, sometimes, I could solve them within 30-50 minutes, sometimes I couldn't. So, I can't really give a proper estimation for this. 

The few other things that I made sure to practice were:
- always speaking out loud no matter what problem I solved. These days, it kinda became a habit. 
- Always made sure to write space and time complexity 
- Once I was confident about problem solving, I put a lot of time on code readability and python-specific features which I will discuss in the later part. 

#### Data Structures & Algorithms 

As I am a working professional and I had only 2month-ish to prepare for everything, I couldn't follow any book or even any course. The resources I followed: 

**GeeksForGeeks**

I studied sorting, greedy algorithms and randomized algorithms from this resource.

**Leetcode Explore Tab**

For everything else which includes - heap, dynamic programming, graph, tree, linked list, stack & queue, I found the leetcode explore to be extremely helpful. As it provides problems ritght after a notes, this helped me clear up many things. 

**Miscelleneous**

Whenever I faced difficulty, I just googled. I don't really have most of the links, but still mentioning the few gems I found on leetcode:

- [Binary Search]( [https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/786126/python-powerful-ultimate-binary-search-template-solved-many-problems](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/786126/python-powerful-ultimate-binary-search-template-solved-many-problems))
- [Substring Problems]([https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/26808/Here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-'substring'-problems](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/discuss/26808/Here-is-a-10-line-template-that-can-solve-most-'substring'-problems))
- [Dynamic Programming](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/458695/dynamic-programming-patterns)
- [Few Tips]([https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1151183/TIPS-or-HACKS-WHICH-YOU-CAN'T-IGNORE-AS-A-CODER](https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/1151183/TIPS-or-HACKS-WHICH-YOU-CAN'T-IGNORE-AS-A-CODER))

#### Problem lists I tried to solve from

- Google tagged questions sorted by frequency from leetcode.
- [Blind75](https://leetcode.com/discuss/general-discussion/460599/blind-75-leetcode-questions)
- problems from leetcode explore cards
- [sean prasad list](https://seanprashad.com/leetcode-patterns/) of leetcode problems(I couldn't solve many from this as I didn't have enough time)

#### Code Readability

Few things that I remember:

- I read the [google python style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html). Couldn't read the whole guide as I didn't have enough time. I just focused more on the sections that would come up in the interviwes
- I made use of namedtuple, enum, dataclass
- Whenever I used anything, I explained the reason behind using it
- If a code logic seemed a bit complex, I used a one-line comment to explain it
- proper logical naming is really important. Even if I couldn't come up with a good name within a short time, I mentioned that to them.
- Writing the test cases in commments

#### Python specific features

- Learn the python data structures by heart. Be ready to explain them if needed. Even if they don't ask you, it's good to know and mention them. At one interview, I did so which made the interviewer impressed
- few data-structures and libraries that might help you: heapq, namedtuple, dataclass, counter, deque, defaultdict
- don't forget to brush up your python basics

#### System Design

I didn't really spend much time on this one. Maybe a video from [gaurav sen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xpDnVSmNFX0&list=PLMCXHnjXnTnvo6alSjVkgxV-VH6EPyvoX) playlist once or twice a week. During the final days, I studied the [grokking](https://www.educative.io/courses/grokking-the-system-design-interview) course. If you have time, I would suggest always keeping yourself up-to-date with the company specific [engineering blogs](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer#company-engineering-blogs).
Few other resources that I didn't follow due to time shortage:
- [system-design-primer](https://github.com/donnemartin/system-design-primer)
- Desigining Data-Intensive Applications by Martin Kleppman

#### Design Patterns
I only had 3-4 days when I learned that I will have an OOD round. So, I just revised a few design patterns(singleton, factory, strategy, decorator etc) that I previously knew about from [here](https://www.oodesign.com/) and [here](https://python-patterns.guide/). 
A few more:
- https://github.com/prasadgujar/low-level-design-primer/blob/master/resources.md
- https://refactoring.guru/

#### Behavioral
I used to study these concepts whenever I had some free time or I felt really tired to solve problems. A few resources:

- https://www.scarletink.com/interviewing-at-amazon-leadership-principles/?fbclid=IwAR12GcEP1A9Ye_dj3ZtxJ8ErD_XAE9O2CyXaCwtkfiwlfWYttYAQDKsYzsA
- https://leetcode.com/explore/interview/card/leapai/
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B-xdfQv3I1k&list=PLLucmoeZjtMQK8T111wCvqnfOd0qGFqzL

I revised and made a document of the details of the projects that I mentioned on the resume. 

#### Miscelleneous Topics
I also revised OS, Database and Networking from undergrad days. Although these didn't come up that much in my case, sometimes, these do. I studied the topics from random sources I found through googling.
